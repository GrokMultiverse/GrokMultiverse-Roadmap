**Version 1.1 – January 2026**

---

## Executive Summary

**GrokMultiverse** is a community-driven ecosystem built on Solana that experiments with **fully on-chain task verification, immutable points tracking, and NFT-based engagement**, starting on Solana Devnet.

The project is designed to reward long-term, authentic participation rather than short-term speculation.  
All early participation occurs strictly on Devnet and is intended for testing, transparency, and ecosystem onboarding.

The $GMV token, if and when launched, will be minted and distributed exclusively through audited custom smart contracts. There are no seed rounds, private sales, or third-party launchpads.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**  
GrokMultiverse ($GMV) is an independent project inspired by multiverse and AI themes.  
It has **no affiliation, endorsement, or connection** with xAI, Elon Musk, or the official Grok AI developed by xAI.

---

## Vision

- Build a sustainable, self-governed token ecosystem on custom Solana smart contracts  
- Reward authentic, long-term community participation  
- Ensure full on-chain transparency and verifiability  
- Use NFTs as participation proofs, not speculative instruments  
- Transition Devnet engagement into carefully designed Mainnet utility  

---

## Ecosystem Overview

The GrokMultiverse ecosystem consists of:

- On-chain task execution via smart contracts  
- Immutable points tracking stored directly on Solana  
- Referral-based onboarding (without point incentives to prevent abuse)  
- Devnet NFT minting for engagement verification  
- Publicly verifiable program IDs and transactions  

All interactions require explicit wallet signatures and are executed directly on Solana.

---

## Wallet Ecosystem Use Case

GrokMultiverse is intentionally designed to be **wallet-safe and onboarding-friendly**.

Users connecting via Solana wallets such as **Phantom** or **Solflare** can participate in Devnet-only on-chain tasks, earn verifiable points, and mint Devnet NFTs **without exposing real funds or value-bearing assets**.

This provides wallet users with:
- A safe environment to interact with on-chain programs  
- Non-transferable proof of real engagement  
- Early participation signals for potential Genesis NFT consideration  
- Zero requirement for token purchases or financial commitment  

The system prioritizes user consent, transparency, and fair participation.

---

## Devnet Scope & Safety Disclaimer

All current GrokMultiverse functionality operates **strictly on Solana Devnet**.

- No real assets or funds are involved  
- No token sale or economic value claim exists at this stage  
- Devnet points and Devnet NFTs do **not** guarantee Mainnet rewards  
- Mainnet eligibility criteria will be announced separately  

GrokMultiverse is an experimental on-chain system intended solely for testing, learning, and community onboarding.

---

## Architecture

- Built using the **Anchor Framework (Rust)** on Solana  
- Manages user PDAs, task verification, points logic, NFT eligibility, and future token distribution  
- No custody of user assets; all actions require explicit wallet approval

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1** – Points Farming (LIVE on Devnet)  
2. **Phase 2** – Devnet NFT Minting  
3. **Phase 3** – Mainnet Genesis NFT Launch & Trading  
4. **Phase 4** – Tokenomics & Utility Activation  
5. **Phase 5** – $GMV Token Launch & Airdrop

## Points System

| Action                 | Points    |
|------------------------|-----------|
| Account Initialization | 1,000 PTS |
| Social Tasks           | 400 PTS   |

**Maximum per user:** 1,400 PTS  

All points are stored immutably on-chain.  
Referral links support onboarding visibility but **do not grant extra points**, ensuring fairness and bot resistance.

---

## NFT Collections

### Devnet NFTs (Engagement Verification)
- Supply: 100,000  
- Purpose: Proof of participation and early engagement signal  
- Nature: Experimental, non-financial, Devnet-only  

Devnet NFTs do not represent ownership, investment value, or guaranteed future rewards.

---

### Mainnet Genesis Collection
- Supply: 100,000  
- Royalties: 7% → Ecosystem Treasury  
- Trading: Solana NFT marketplaces (e.g., Magic Eden, Tensor)  
- Utility:
  - Required for $GMV airdrop eligibility  
  - Governance participation  
  - Future ecosystem access  

---

## Security & Transparency

- All core smart contracts are publicly accessible  
- No off-chain manipulation of points or eligibility  
- All interactions are wallet-signed and user-initiated  
- Transaction data is fully verifiable on-chain  

Before any Mainnet token deployment:
- Contracts will undergo further testing and review  
- Security best practices will be enforced  
- Third-party audits will be completed as required  

User safety and transparency are core design principles.

---

## Tokenomics ($GMV)

**Total Supply:** 21,000,000 (fixed)  
**Token Type:** Custom SPL Token on Solana Mainnet

| Allocation            | Percentage | Amount      | Vesting / Notes                           |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Community Airdrop     | 40%        | 8,400,000   | Points + NFT-based distribution            |
| Team & Contributors   | 40%        | 8,400,000   | 5-year linear vesting (no unlock year 1)   |
| Ecosystem Treasury    | 10%        | 2,100,000   | Development, rewards, partnerships         |
| Marketing & Growth    | 9%         | 1,890,000   | Controlled community initiatives           |
| Charitable Allocation | 1%         | 210,000     | Community-voted causes                     |

---

## Airdrop Model

**Eligibility Requirements**
- Hold at least one Mainnet Genesis NFT  
- Complete full 1,400 PTS on Devnet  
- Verified on-chain activity snapshot at end of Phase 4  

**Distribution Structure**
- 50% claimable at launch  
- 50% vested linearly over 5 years  

**Airdrop Formula**

User Share =  
`(User Points × 8,400,000) ÷ Total Qualified Points`

Participation does not guarantee any specific token amount.

---

## Future Utility & Governance

Potential post-launch utilities include:
- Staking and reward mechanisms  
- Community governance voting  
- In-ecosystem upgrades and access  
- Experimental integrations (gaming, metaverse, etc.)

All utilities will be introduced gradually and transparently.
