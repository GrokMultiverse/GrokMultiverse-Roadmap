**Version 1.1 – January 2026**

---

## Executive Summary
**GrokMultiverse** is a community-driven ecosystem on Solana that rewards long-term participation through on-chain tasks, digital collectible NFTs, and a points-based token economy.

The $GMV token will be minted and distributed exclusively through audited custom smart contracts. There are no seed rounds, private sales, or third-party launchpads.

**⚠️ Disclaimer**  
GrokMultiverse ($GMV) is an independent, community-driven project inspired by multiverse and AI themes.  
It has **no affiliation, endorsement, or connection** with xAI, Elon Musk, or the official Grok AI developed by xAI.

---

## Vision
- Build a sustainable, self-governed token ecosystem on custom smart contracts.
- Reward authentic, long-term community participation.
- Ensure full on-chain transparency via Solana.
- Drive value through NFT ownership and phased unlocks.
- Transition Devnet engagement into lasting Mainnet utility.

---

## Architecture
- Built with **Anchor Framework (Rust)** on Solana.
- Manages user PDAs, task verification, NFT eligibility, and token distribution.
- **Admin Wallet:** `PWTPrTgMX2WM1gbsFSib7RrYiXPEvVR6t13n1zWht4G`
- **Devnet Program ID:** `8D7Pw7foY4ba7AJU18Pyq8gUTKAo71j3n3Lo8rDRjw4y`  
  → [Solana Explorer (Devnet)](https://explorer.solana.com/address/8D7Pw7foY4ba7AJU18Pyq8gUTKAo71j3n3Lo8rDRjw4y?cluster=devnet)

---

## Roadmap
1. **Phase 1** – Points Farming (LIVE on Devnet)  
2. **Phase 2** – Devnet NFT Minting  
3. **Phase 3** – Mainnet NFT Launch & Trading  
4. **Phase 4** – Tokenomics & Utility Activation  
5. **Phase 5** – $GMV Token Launch & Airdrop

---

## Points System
| Action                  | Points   |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Account Initialization  | 1,000 PTS |
| Social Tasks            | 400 PTS  |

**Max per User:** 1,400 PTS  
All data stored immutably on-chain. Referrals encourage growth but do not award extra points to maintain fairness.

---

## NFT Collections

### Devnet NFTs (Early Access)
- Supply: 100,000
- Purpose: Engagement verification & Mainnet eligibility

### Mainnet Genesis Collection
- Supply: 100,000
- Royalties: 7% → Ecosystem treasury (development, rewards, marketing)
- Trading: Magic Eden, Tensor, and other Solana marketplaces
- Utility: Required for $GMV airdrop eligibility + future governance and ecosystem features

---

## Tokenomics ($GMV)
**Total Supply:** 21,000,000 (fixed)  
**Token Type:** Custom SPL Token on Solana Mainnet

| Allocation                | Percentage | Amount      | Vesting / Notes                              |
|---------------------------|------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Community Airdrop         | 40%        | 8,400,000   | Points + NFT-based distribution              |
| Team & Contributors       | 40%        | 8,400,000   | 5-year linear vesting (no unlocks year 1)    |
| Ecosystem Treasury        | 10%        | 2,100,000   | Development, partnerships, holder rewards     |
| Marketing & Growth        | 9%         | 1,890,000   | Controlled community initiatives             |
| Charitable Donations      | 1%         | 210,000     | Community-voted causes                       |

**Safety Measures**
- Team allocation: 5-year linear vesting
- Initial liquidity: Locked or burned at launch
- All critical contracts: Third-party audited before Mainnet token deployment

---

## Airdrop Model
**Eligibility**
- Hold at least one Mainnet Genesis NFT
- Completed full 1,400 PTS task cap on Devnet
- Verified on-chain activity (snapshot at end of Phase 4)

**Distribution**
- 50% of calculated share claimable immediately
- Remaining 50% vested over 5 years (same schedule as team)

**Post-Vesting Bonus**  
Loyal holders still owning original NFTs after the 5-year period will be eligible for an additional airdrop from the Ecosystem Treasury.

**Airdrop Calculation**  
User's share of the 8,400,000 community tokens is determined proportionally by points earned:

**User Share = (User Points × 8,400,000) ÷ Total Qualified Points**

---

## Future Utility & Governance
Post-token launch, planned $GMV utilities include:
- Staking for additional rewards
- Community governance voting
- In-ecosystem purchases and upgrades
- Potential metaverse or gaming integrations
